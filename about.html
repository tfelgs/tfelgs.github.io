        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I am currently attending Iowa State University, expecting to graduate after 
          the spring semester of 2023 with a double major in Management Information Systems 
          and Business Analytics. Currently, I work at Iowa State University as an On-Site 
          Technician. In this position I can be found working on different projects ranging 
          from critical, time-sensitive issues to month long assignments. I troubleshoot and 
          quickly fix problems associated with any device under our support like Dell laptops 
          and HP printers. I also utilize the ServiceNow system to efficiently understand 
          background information while clearly communicating with clients. I have adapted 
          strong problem-solving skills, patience, and time management skills with this job. 
          While attending Iowa State University, I have completed courses and academic projects 
          to which have enhanced my knowledge towards my majors. To name a few, I have created 
          entity-relationship diagrams, developed a database with Oracle SQL language, and 
          manipulated data from CSV files. I am interested in looking for an internship for 
          the summer of 2022.
