          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello, I am currently attending Iowa State University, expecting to graduate after
            the spring semester of 2023 with a double major in Management Information Systems
            and Business Analytics. Currently, I work at Iowa State University as an On-Site
            Technician. In this position I can be found working on different projects ranging
            from critical, time-sensitive issues to month long assignments. I troubleshoot and
            quickly fix problems associated with any device under our support like Dell laptops
            and HP printers. I also utilize the ServiceNow system to efficiently understand
            background information while clearly communicating with clients. I have adapted
            strong problem-solving skills, patience, and time management skills with this job.
            While attending Iowa State University, I have completed courses and academic projects
            to which have enhanced my knowledge towards my majors. To name a few, I have created
            entity-relationship diagrams, developed a database with Oracle SQL language, and
            manipulated data from CSV files. I am interested in looking for an internship for
            the summer of 2022.
