					Currently, I am attending Iowa State University expecting to graduate after the spring semester
					of 2023 with a double major in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics.
					While I am a full-time student, I am also a software engineer working at TMC
					Transportation in Ames, Iowa. Within the past 6 months I was on a team of 3 interns
					developing a full-stack .NET web application that analyzed data for our cybersecurity
					team. We created AWS Lambda functions, implemented web scraping, set up a Power BI
					dashboard, and designed new tables in our database all while utilizing agile methodology
					on an Azure DevOps board. I am looking for a software engineering position in the Houston
					area after my graduation in the spring of 2023.

							allow users to become more aware of what they are taking and the overall effect it

							cereal and managers print reports. These reports can be, for example, calculating
							average prices, finding what cereals are under or above a certain stock, and a
							record of sales for a certain product. After completing a sale product inventory can
							be queried to show the updated amount along with many other functions.
