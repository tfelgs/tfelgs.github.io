					developing a full-stack .NET web application that analyzed data for our cybersecurity
					team. We created AWS Lambda functions, implemented web scraping, set up a Power BI
					dashboard, and designed new tables in our database all while utilizing agile methodology
					on an Azure DevOps board. I am looking for a software engineering position in the Chicago
					area after my graduation in the spring of 2023.

							<br />
							<div class="cardText">
								Apto is designed to help everyone learn more information on what supplements to take
								for a variety of performance or health related goals. Many businesses are not
								explaining the basic effect or goal of these supplements, but rather sayinig it will
								just make you look like whatever influencer is marketing the product. Apto will
								allow users to become more aware of what they are taking and the overall effect it
								has on their actual performance or health.
							</div>
							<br />
							<div class="cardTools">
								• Developed a web application using the MERN stack to inform users on different
								health supplements. <br />
								• Used Semantic UI React for flexible theming support. <br />
								• Collaborated with and led a team of 3 to achieve goals and meet deadlines.

							<div class="cardTitle">Grocery Management System</div>
							<br />
							<div class="cardText">
								Fake grocery data was created based on Walmart's cereal aisle. When users first run
								the program they can either log in as a manager or cutomer. Customers purchase
								cereal and managers print reports. These reports can be, for example, calculating
								average prices, finding what cereals are under or above a certain stock, and a
								record of sales for a certain product. After completing a sale product inventory can
								be queried to show the updated amount along with many other functions.
							</div>
							<br />
							<div class="cardTools">
								• Used Python to return managerial reports based on grocery data. <br />
								• SQLite and Pandas were used to help read, analyze, and query data. <br />
								• Updated inventory and new costs were updated as a customer shopped the system.
